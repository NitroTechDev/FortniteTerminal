# FortniteTerminal

This works with the latest verson of fortnite, because of commom mistakes please compile in x64 and not x86

This will rarely ever need a update, even if fortnite updates I wont have to update here.

A DLL that creates a UE4 terminal for fortnite

CheatManager/FortCheatManager commands will not work (eg: toggledebugcamera, summon, destorycall, etc)

Be careful when using showdebug as it lags the game because it cant find the font!!! (I will update later because im lazy)

MUST DISABLE ANTI CHEAT CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH YOU WILL BE BANNED!!!!!
